## Description

The user can run tictactoe in the terminal using the TextUI main. Or run the True main using the GameUI. The user can save, load, create and inspect player profiles using the player profile menu. Only two players can be loaded and they can be dynamically loaded mid-game. The user can choose from tictactoe and number tictactoe. Both of which have their respective save/load files. File fromatting should exactly follow that which is given. In the numbers game the user can only play the numbers that are promtped after selecting a square. Both games have their respective win conditions. When inspecting a player profile the controller must input the name of the profile they want to inspect. If the input matches a loaded profile, the record is displayed. Similarly, for saving the same mechanic applies, but instead the controller is prompted with a file browser in the assets dirctory. The controller must select the desired file to save to. For profile loading, the controller is promtped with a file select in the assets directory. The controller is to select the desired directory and if the file is valid, the player is loaded in. Only two profiles can be loaded in at a time. The first player loaded in goes first for Tic Tac Toe, but second for the number game. The opposite is true for the second player. This is so there is no clear advantage in loading in first.
