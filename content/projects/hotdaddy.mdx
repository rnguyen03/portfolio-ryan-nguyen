## The Idea
Set yourself up for success ~ Designed for the phone, HotDaddy was created to provide a seamless and motivating fitness experience, empowering you to achieve your health and fitness goals anytime, anywhere.

Health and fitness have two main components: executing the exercise and tracking the progress. If exercising becomes a habit, then the user is more likely to be healthier. The aim of app is to remove the barriers and excuses that prohibit the user from working out.


## The Solution
The core feature is the repetition counter, which allows the user to focus on the movement rather than the progress, removing a barrier. This enables the website to track and display the user's progress, motivating them and making it easier to stick to a routine.

HotDaddy includes social features such as sharing progress with friends, joining fitness challenges, and earning rewards for consistent activity. These elements create a supportive community environment, encouraging users to stay committed to their fitness journey.

When users log in for the first time, they will see a small sapling. As they progress in their workouts, the sapling will grow, eventually blossoming into a full-grown tree, symbolizing their fitness journey and achievements.

## Tools
HotDaddy is built with Jeremy.js, GCP, Next, Fireabase, Figma, Tailwind, Teachable Machiine, LottieFiles.
