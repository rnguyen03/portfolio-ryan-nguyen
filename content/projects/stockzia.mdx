## About Tech

* output.js is mostly for making cards, call functions that get data needed
* chart.js makes the graphs, calls the search function to get the data
* app.js is where the program is run and controlled from
* search.js is where the stock market api is called and json is returned
* index.html is what is used to run the page


## Run Bot Locally

1. You will first need accounts with the following services (all of the following services provide a free tier and/or student trials)
        * IBM Cloud (IBM Watson)
        * IEX Cloud (Stock Market Api Data)
        * Cloudinary (image hosting)
        * Plotly (chart maker)
        * AlphaVantage (S&P, NASDAQ, DJI data)
2. Gather Api credentials and plug them into the .env_unfilled file
        * Note that for IBM Cloud you have to first make an Watson Assistant Service, and use the Api Keys for that
        * Note that not all the .env fields need to be filled to run locally
        * Note change the `.env_unfilled filename` to `.env`
3. Run the "index.html" file. You can do this by simply opening the html file up in a web browser such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.
        *Note that appid and password don't need to be set in the .env and emulator for local deployments 
4. Say 'Hello' and everything should be setup and working locally
