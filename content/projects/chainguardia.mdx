# ChainGuard 🛡️

> **Real-time supply chain security monitoring with AI-powered vulnerability intelligence**

## Overview

ChainGuard is a security dashboard that helps organizations proactively monitor their software inventory and identify vulnerabilities in real-time. The platform aggregates security data from multiple authoritative sources and uses AI to provide actionable insights, helping security teams respond to threats before they can be exploited.

Built in 36 hours during Hack the Valley X, ChainGuard addresses a critical gap in enterprise security: **continuous monitoring of third-party tools**. Even whitelisted applications can become attack vectors when vulnerabilities are discovered post-approval—and most organizations lack the infrastructure to detect these threats in real-time.

## The Problem

Modern organizations rely on dozens of third-party applications—Slack, Figma, Notion, browser extensions, and more. While these tools boost productivity, they also create a expanding attack surface. The challenge isn't just adoption; it's **continuous risk management**:

- **Whitelists don't update themselves**: A plugin that was safe last month might be compromised today
- **Startups lack monitoring resources**: Smaller teams can't track every app manually
- **Alert fatigue is real**: Security teams need contextualized, prioritized intelligence—not raw CVE dumps
- **Time-to-response is critical**: The window between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation is shrinking

During development, we consulted with a cybersecurity expert who confirmed this is one of the fastest-growing problems in the industry—with no reliable automated solution currently available.

**ChainGuard doesn't just detect attacks; it predicts them.**

## Core Functionality

1. **Application Inventory**: Organizations add their software applications (manually or via CSV bulk import)
2. **Continuous Threat Monitoring**: Backend constantly pulls new intelligence from CVE databases, NIST advisories, and security feeds
3. **Intelligent Matching**: Automatically correlates published vulnerabilities with your application stack
4. **AI-Powered Risk Analysis**: Google Gemini evaluates technical impact, business context, and provides confidence scores
5. **Real-Time Alerts**: Security teams receive instant notifications when threats affect their tools
6. **Remediation Tracking**: Teams acknowledge alerts and track mitigation progress through resolution

**The key differentiator**: ChainGuard combines real-time data aggregation with AI reasoning to transform raw threat intelligence into digestible, actionable insights that even non-technical stakeholders can understand.
